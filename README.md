## Introduction
We introduce **temporal working memory** (TWM), which aims to enhance the temporal modeling capabilities of Multimodal foundation models (MFMs). It selectively retains task-relevant information across temporal dimensions, ensuring that critical details are preserved throughout the processing of video and audio content. The TWM uses a query-guided attention approach to focus on the most informative multimodal segments within temporal sequences. By retaining only the most relevant content, TWM optimizes the use of the model's limited capacity, enhancing its temporal modeling ability. This plug-and-play module can be easily integrated into existing MFMs. With our TWM, nine state-of-the-art models exhibit significant performance improvements across **question answering**, **video captioning**, and **video-text retrieval** tasks.

## Project Overview

This code repository includes implementations of the Temporal Working Memory (TWM) mechanism algorithm applied to nine different state-of-the-art models. The steps to run the code are as follows:

1. **Download the repository**: Clone this repository to your local environment.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare data following the preprocessing steps in each original model repository.
3. **Training Temporal Working Memory (TWM)**: For each model, adjust the number of training epochs and relevant model-specific hyperparameters in the `main_alvs.py` file within each modelâ€™s directory. Follow the recommendations in each model's original paper for parameter settings, and then train TWM.
4. **Inference**: Set `epochs = 0` in each model's `main_alvs.py` file, and run to utilize TWM.
